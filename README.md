(Exercise) The "BSTreeApp" is a Python GUI application using Tkinter to create and manipulate a Binary Search Tree (BST). It allows users to insert names into the tree, display information such as size, height, minimum, and maximum elements, check if the tree is balanced, and perform in-order, pre-order, post-order, and levelOrder traversals.
